# Launching Our First Business Incubator Cohort

We're thrilled to announce the launch of our inaugural Business Incubator program, welcoming 12 exceptional Black entrepreneurs who are building the next generation of safety-focused businesses. After receiving over 200 applications from across the country, we've selected a diverse group of founders who share our vision of creating economic opportunity while strengthening community safety.

## Meet Our Cohort

This year's cohort represents the best of Black entrepreneurship, with founders building solutions in areas ranging from neighborhood safety technology to community economic development. Each entrepreneur brings unique experiences and perspectives that will enrich our entire community.

### Featured Entrepreneurs

**Alexandra Thompson** is building SafeRoute, a navigation app that helps users find the safest walking and driving routes based on real-time community data and historical safety information.

**David Richardson** founded Community Credit, a financial services platform that provides microloans and credit-building tools specifically designed for residents of underserved neighborhoods.

**Tameka Foster** created NeighborLink, a social platform that connects neighbors for mutual aid, safety coordination, and community resource sharing.

## Program Highlights

Over the next 12 months, our cohort will receive:

- **Seed funding** of up to $50,000 per company
- **Intensive mentorship** from successful Black entrepreneurs and industry leaders
- **Workshop series** covering everything from product development to fundraising
- **Access to our network** of investors, customers, and partners
- **Office space** in our downtown headquarters
- **Legal and accounting support** to ensure proper business foundation

## The Application Process

Selecting just 12 companies from over 200 applications was incredibly difficult. Our selection committee evaluated each application based on:

- **Innovation and market potential** of the business idea
- **Focus on community safety** and social impact
- **Founder experience** and commitment to the mission
- **Scalability** and potential for widespread impact
- **Cultural fit** with our values and approach

## Looking Ahead

This incubator represents just the beginning of our commitment to supporting Black entrepreneurs. We're already planning our next cohort for 2026, and we're exploring partnerships with other organizations to expand our reach and impact.

We believe that strong Black businesses create strong Black communities, and strong Black communities are safer communities. By supporting these entrepreneurs, we're investing in the future of community safety and economic opportunity.
